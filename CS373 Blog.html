**What are your expectations of the class?**
I am hoping to gain practical experience working on software development projects as well as experience working with a large team on a project. I gained some experience working with some of the development tools we will be going over in this class during my previous internship but would like to improve my understanding of those tools.

**What did you do this past week?**
This week started out with basic introductions to the class as well as my classmates. We also took time to look over the blog posts of students who took this class before us, giving us a good idea of what the day to day will be like for the duration of this class. I then had a simple refresher on Docker and learned the strengths and weaknesses of assertions in Python during the next class. Most recently I took some time to figure out how to set up a website in order to be able to write this blog. 

**What's in your way?**
I currently have nothing impeding my progress in this class. I'm sure that will not continue into further weeks though. At least I hope so, the challenge is half the fun! 

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I need to start looking for a group to work with on the projects. I heard from previous students that getting a strong group is extremely important for success in the class, and currently I don't know very many of my classmates. I also plan to work through a few HackerRank problems to improve my fluency with python as I feel like improving my skills will help me on the projects in this class.

**What's my experience of the class?**
My experience in this class has been about what I expected it to be. I had heard a lot about the class from friends who had already taken it, and most of what they told me has held up. It definitely seems like a class that will benefit me a lot even though it also seems like it will take a lot of hard work. 

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
Don't try and upload a .xcf image to your GitHub page, it won't show up properly. I spent an embarrassingly long time trying to find the problem before I finally realized I just needed to switch the image format. I'm going to need a lot more practice making websites.
