## Week of 15 Jan - 21 Jan:

**What are your expectations of the class?**
I am hoping to gain practical experience working on software development projects as well as experience working with a large team on a project. I gained some experience working with some of the development tools we will be going over in this class during my previous internship but would like to improve my understanding of those tools.

**What did you do this past week?**
This week started out with basic introductions to the class as well as my classmates. We also took time to look over the blog posts of students who took this class before us, giving us a good idea of what the day to day will be like for the duration of this class. I then had a simple refresher on Docker and learned the strengths and weaknesses of assertions in Python during the next class. Most recently I took some time to figure out how to set up a website in order to be able to write this blog. 

**What's in your way?**
I currently have nothing impeding my progress in this class. I'm sure that will not continue into further weeks though. At least I hope so, the challenge is half the fun! 

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I need to start looking for a group to work with on the projects. I heard from previous students that getting a strong group is extremely important for success in the class, and currently I don't know very many of my classmates. I also plan to work through a few HackerRank problems to improve my fluency with python as I feel like improving my skills will help me on the projects in this class.

**What's my experience of the class?**
My experience in this class has been about what I expected it to be. I had heard a lot about the class from friends who had already taken it, and most of what they told me has held up. It definitely seems like a class that will benefit me a lot even though it also seems like it will take a lot of hard work. 

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
Don't try and upload a .xcf image to your GitHub page, it won't show up properly. I spent an embarrassingly long time trying to find the problem before I finally realized I just needed to switch the image format. I'm going to need a lot more practice making websites.

## Week of 22 Jan - 28 Jan:

**What did you do this past week?**
This past week I looked into ways to improve the performance of solving the Collatz problem. Downing provided us with a lot of good resources to accomplish this, as well as provided us with some ideas during class. I also read a lot about extreme programming, a management style that I had experienced somewhat during my internship but never really knew formally. I am also learning a lot about the importance of testing thoroughly and read a paper about how an entire rocket blew up because of a minor error in the code.

**What's in your way?**
Nothing except other work is currently in my way. I do need to get a better understanding of GitHub to be able to deal with all of the requirements for the project, but I am already fairly strong in python so the actual coding shouldn't take me very long. 

**What will you do next week?**
I still need to find a group to do the projects with. I also need to begin to learn JavaScript as it will be needed for one of the projects and I only have experience using it to write exploits. It would also be helpful for me to look into Travis CI more to get a better understanding of how that works as I know very little about the software.

**What's my experience of the class?**
I like the class so far. I'm definitely not a big fan of the quizzes every day, but it does do a good job of keeping me up with the reading, whether that is for better or worse any particular week. Downing is a very strong lecturer and it seems like his projects are going to be extremely helpful for strengthening my large-scale development and teamwork skills, even if they seem a bit silly for the small scale of the projects. 

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
If any of y'all are interested in machine vision, I would recommend checking out MatLab, it has a lot of great libraries for image processing and is extremely powerful. If Matlab is too expensive for you and you're not a student (students can get it free) then try Octave or Python's OpenCV, as they are also very strong.

## Week of 29 Jan - 4 Feb:

**What did you do this past week?**
This past week I finished the first project in this class as well as a project in cloud computing that automatically spins up an EC2 instance. This class's project didn't have a very difficult coding portion but learning to use all of the development tools he required ended up being a good amount of effort. In class, we went over a lot of information about what is going on behind the scenes in Python and Java, which feels a lot like 314 but does seem to be helping me get a better understanding of my code and allow for a lot more fluidity in my code.

**What's in your way?**
Nothing is currently in my way. Have a Machine Vision project due on Friday that could potentially take a long time so I am going to have to be very careful about managing my time next week.

**What will you do next week?**
I still need to find a group to work with for the upcoming project, so I will definitely get that done as I'm almost out of time. I fell pretty behind on my work finishing projects this week so hopefully, I will be able to catch back up on it next week, as I don't want to be too far behind when tests start to come up. 

**What's my experience of the class?**
The class is slowly introducing me to a whole new style of programming that is very strong in large groups or on long term projects. This will definitely make me a lot stronger asset during internships and maybe even on side projects if I ever begin to add others to them. I really like that the class is mainly in Python as I have been wanting to learn it formally for a while even though I've used it a lot in the past.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
If you use your UT email to get AWS Educate you can get $100 of additional free credit to Amazon Web Services, so if any of y'all have code you need a lot of computing power to run that could be a great way to get through it without having to invest in better hardware. Its also a great resource to start getting use to as cloud computing continues to grow.

## Week of 5 Feb - 11 Feb:

**What did you do this past week?**
I finished working on my computer vision project this week. We got to create a program that could perform content-aware resizing using seam carving and use the program on a lot of images to test and create interesting results. For this class, my team and I finally found out an idea for the project and are starting to work our way through it. Personally I have set up the GitHub, briefly learned most of the development tools we are using to get a better idea of the project in general, and worked on getting the ever frustrating Instagram API to work.

**What's in your way?**
We are having some confusion on how to actually use Flask with Apache and AWS. I am starting to get a better understanding of what it's for and what its used for, but how to apply it to what we are doing still isn't clear. We are also having some difficulty with the Instagram API as it is way more confusing than the google one.

**What will you do next week?**
I plan to finish getting all of the data for the APIs to give to my team as well as figure out how to utilize flask and set it up with our project as my main priorities. I will also try and help with what is left over when I finish with those jobs. Hopefully, I will also get a chance to earn how everyone else did their parts as I would like to get an understanding of more than one part of the project.

**What's my experience of the class?**
The class has been good so far. I wish we would have been taught some of these development tools briefly in class so that we didn't have to go in blind, but it's not too big of an issue. The project is pretty challenging, especially since I have never worked on anything like this before, but I really like the challenge. 

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
If you have an image you want to resize that has a lot of fluff/unimportant content and you want to keep the main content the same size try looking into seam carving. It's a great way to do that by cutting out pixels you wouldn't really notice much anyway.

## Week of 12 Feb - 18 Feb:

**What did you do this past week?**
We finished the first stage of our project this week. I personally did a lot of the work gathering data through the API's we found and set up the API for our website. I also did the work to set up the GitHub for the team. After I finished that project I did my project for Cloud Computing which was making a program to use Amazon S3. My 21'st was also this weekend so I had a party to celebrate that which was a lot of fun.

**What's in your way?**
Currently, the main thing in my way is my lack of knowledge on how to actually make an API that will interact with our website. I feel like this will be a large part of the work that I do on the next project so I will need to start researching it. Other than that the only thing in my way is other work I need to do.

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I will put a lot of effort into the second stage of the project in order to get a head start on it after my test is done on Monday. I also need to continue working on some of my side projects as they have been put on the backburner due to my crazy busy schedule the last few weeks. 

**What's my experience of the class?**
I liked working with my group a lot, at least the ones that showed up. The group you end up with in this class I feel like is the biggest determinant of whether you will actually end up liking the class or not because if they are good the nights that you're up working until 3 A.M don't seem so bad anymore.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
If you want to try your hand at doing work with neural networks, try using TensorFlow. It's made by Google and makes creating and training elaborate networks extremely simple to do. I personally used it a lot in Neural Networks when I took the class and used it to make programs from something as simple as an evaluating Pi to something as complicated as making a network to play SuperTux.

## Week of 19 Feb - 25 Feb:

**What did you do this past week?**
Last week started off with a test in Finance and then was followed by a lot of recruiting due to the career fair and an interview with RetailMeNot on Friday. Last week my soccer and dodgeball team make playoffs for IM as well. The cloud computing project was working to set up an API for Amazon S3 and will hopefully be used on the project in this class at some point.

**What's in your way?**
Currently what's in my way is a lack of time. I need to put more focus into recruiting in case I don't get any of the jobs I interviewed/applied for recently and have a lot of tests/projects coming up at the same time as doing all of this. I really want to have time to put into some of my side research projects, but at this rate, it might not happen for a while.

**What will you do next week?**
Next week is the test for this class, so obviously I will be studying for that. I also have a computer vision project I need to finish and more recruiting I should be doing. Hopefully, I will find some time to work on the aforementioned side projects as well as the week progresses. If I can find the time, I also would like to squeeze in some bouldering as it has been way too long since I have gone.

**What's my experience of the class?**
This class has been extremely helpful for the interviews I have been doing. Python is a really clean language for coding on a whiteboard and my new found strong understanding of the language allows me to be confident when I am coding in front of people. The group work aspect of this class has also allowed me to answer a bunch of the behavioral and leadership problems they threw at me. I would definitely recommend people take this class if they think they are going to be doing any interviewing that semester.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
Hough Transform is a great technique for detecting shapes within an image. It is not too difficult to implement yourself if you want to and can lead to some very cool results if you enjoy playing with images.

## Week of 26 Feb - 4 Mar:

**What did you do this past week?**
This last week was a long one as I had a project to do in Computer Vision as well as a test for this class. The test turned out to be really easy as it was basically just slight renditions of the HackeRank exercises we did in class. The computer vision project was really cool. We created a program that could segment images based on color and texture and then another that could find circles of various sizes in an image. 

**What's in your way?**
I have two tests coming up so that will be taking up most of my time this week. I still hope we are able to get started on the project for this class so I don't have too much to do over spring break. Hopefully, this week won't be as crazy as last week and I will be able to do stuff that isn't related to school for a while. 

**What will you do next week?**
Next week is going to be mostly studying for my exams. I have one and Cloud Computing and Computer Vision, both on the same day. Past that I kind of want to just have a chill week where I work on mostly side projects/further recruiting. I also need to take some time though to work on the project for this class as I said, and will probably start off with trying to find out how to dynamically take the data we need from the API's we found. 

**What's my experience of the class?**
I have enjoyed the class so far. The class doesn't seem like it is particularly hard outside of the projects. I am really enjoying how well I am learning Python, though the JavaScript lessons seem a bit forced. I personally have never really liked JavaScript and will probably never have to use it, but I understand others might want to learn the language.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
If you are looking to segment of certain parts of an image, try using segmentations other than just color. There are a lot of possible filters you can try that would probably return way better results. Texture is a very common one, though it still has problems with a lot of images. Another thing you could try is using Hough Transform and looking for specific shapes to segment out.

## Week of 5 Mar - 11 Mar:

**What did you do this past week?**
This last week was spent preparing for tests as I had two of them on Thursday, one in Computer Vision and one in Cloud Computing. Thankfully I got a lot of time to study as I didn't have too much other work due that week. Once those tests were done I spent basically the rest of the week either playing ultimate or catching up on sleep as I was way overtired from the first half of the semester. 

**What's in your way?**
Currently, the only things in my way are the projects I need to work on that are due shortly after Spring Break, and don't have much experience doing anything related to what these projects are about. I should have plenty of time to work on them over the break so hopefully, that won't be too much of a problem. 

**What will you do next week?**
Next week is spring break. I need to put a lot of work into my Cloud Computing project as well as a lot of work into the project for this class. This part of the project seems like it is going to take a while and we are currently not that far along in it as we have all been really busy. The first thing I plan to work on in the project is helping to set up the database and writing the code to pull information from it. 

**What's my experience of the class?**
The class has been great so far. The test went really well and I really liked the only programming design behind it. The project is still really interesting despite the difficulties. I really enjoy that this class isn't mostly theory as I have been taking a lot of classes like that and feel like my actual implementation skills were suffering because of it. 

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
If you are trying to match objects that may have different scales or rotations, try looking into SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform). It uses detected features and the magnitude of the gradients in those features to describe images and compare them to other images. It is a really powerful and fast algorithm that is used a lot commercially as well.

## Week of 19 Mar - 25 Mar:

**What did you do this past week?**
The beginning of this week was taken up by the cloud project that I needed to finish. After that, I spend most of my time finishing the project for this class, as it was a lot of work for this phase. I also had an interview with Innoplexus, so we will see if I get an offer. Finally, my team made it to te intramural dodgeball championship so I did that as well. 

**What's in your way?**
Next week I have to do my project for computer vision, which always takes a good amount of time. I also have to get started working on the project for this class so that we can get the work done more smoothly. Finally, intramural frisbee starts up this week and will be taking up a bit of my time. 

**What will you do next week?**
The beginning of the week will be mostly the project for computer vision, as I want to be able to have plenty of time to finish it. Hopefully, I will have some time to work on non-school stuff as well this week, it will really depend on how long the vision project takes. I want to spend some time next week working to get back into shape again, as I have been slacking on that recently due to a significant lack of time.

**What's my experience of the class?**
This class has been a great experience so far. Working with a group is definitely good practice for the workforce and the projects are really interesting as well as satisfying. This class prepares you extremely well for interviews in Python and has definitely helped me out a bunch. The HackerRank exercises definitely make me more confident in writing more unconventional code and I feel like that is also extremely helpful.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
All of the services on AWS have an API for using them, allowing you to automatically do a lot of the work that would normally have to be done manually. Taking some time to figure out how these work and set them up could end up saving you a ton of time on your projects, especially when dealing with the database and the EC2 instances.

## Week of 26 Mar - 1 Apr:

**What did you do this past week?**
I played a lot of ultimate this past week and did a bunch of running. I really want to get back into shape again. Sadly, I hurt my toe a good bit in the Greenbelt and might not be able to run for a while (hopefully not very long). I also have done work on some of the three projects I have due next week, though this week is going to be rough regardless. 

**What's in your way?**
Currently, my hurt toe and all the projects I have due this week are in my way. I won't have free time for much until these are all turned in. After these are done I should have some time to myself, but it never is long. I also can't do any running workouts until the doc gives the ok on my toe, which will put a damper on my training for the 4 by 4. 

**What will you do next week?**
I plan to spend most of this week working on projects. I have one due in Cloud Computing, Computer Vision, and this class. If I get the opportunity to leave the GDC basement next week, that time will be spent going to the gym to lift. It definitely is going to be a productive week, even if it is rather uneventful. 

**What's my experience of the class?**
I am really glad we are learning SQL. I have been meaning to learn it on my own as knowing how to manage data will be infinitely useful with the machine learning stuff I do. I really didn't want to have to take Data Management as I heard it is a massive waste of time. I think the idea behind the language is really cool and efficient and hopefully will be pretty strong in it by the time this class is done.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
This one is an oldie but a goodie. Don't procrastinate! Try and get an idea of everything you have coming up next week before you spend the entire weekend doing non-work related stuff. Otherwise, you can end up with only a few hours o sleep every night. Trust me, I speak from experience.

## Week of 2 Apr - 8 Apr:

**What did you do this past week?**
Last week was pretty brutal. I had 3 projects due in the first half of the week. I was thankfully able to get them all done and still manage to get around 6 hours of sleep over the course of those 4 days. The first project was a Computer Vision project making it so that you could stitch images together if they had the same optical center or add an image to a plane on another photo if they did not. The next project was Cloud Computing and I had to create a website on AWS Elastic Beanstalk that had an SQL server on Amazon's RDS that could add, keep track of, and search movie data. Finally, I had to finish up the project for this class with my team.

**What's in your way?**
I have a fairly chill week coming up but followed by another fairly hard week. Hopefully, I can end up balancing out those a bit.My toe injury has gotten a lot better but hasn't fully healed up. I really want that to get better so I can start running again. 

**What will you do next week?**
I need to do some work on projects that are not due until the week after but will pile up otherwise. I also plan to try and play as much ultimate as I can despite not being able to run much. Hopefully, I will have some time to catch up on sleep as well. 

**What's my experience of the class?**
I am still enjoying this class. I like the material we are learning right now and really appreciate that he is going over the refactoring example with us. This recent material has definitely helped me understand how to make my code stronger and more adaptable, as I usually just tended for very simple and specialized code.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
Be careful when you are working with programs like AWS as they are very complex and sometimes things that shouldn't have any effect on the program can end up making it crash. For example, on my cloud project, my code kept failing when I deployed it until I removed some useless code that did nothing and it suddenly worked.
