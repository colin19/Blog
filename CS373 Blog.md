## Week of 15 Jan - 21 Jan:

**What are your expectations of the class?**
I am hoping to gain practical experience working on software development projects as well as experience working with a large team on a project. I gained some experience working with some of the development tools we will be going over in this class during my previous internship but would like to improve my understanding of those tools.

**What did you do this past week?**
This week started out with basic introductions to the class as well as my classmates. We also took time to look over the blog posts of students who took this class before us, giving us a good idea of what the day to day will be like for the duration of this class. I then had a simple refresher on Docker and learned the strengths and weaknesses of assertions in Python during the next class. Most recently I took some time to figure out how to set up a website in order to be able to write this blog. 

**What's in your way?**
I currently have nothing impeding my progress in this class. I'm sure that will not continue into further weeks though. At least I hope so, the challenge is half the fun! 

**What will you do next week?**
Next week I need to start looking for a group to work with on the projects. I heard from previous students that getting a strong group is extremely important for success in the class, and currently I don't know very many of my classmates. I also plan to work through a few HackerRank problems to improve my fluency with python as I feel like improving my skills will help me on the projects in this class.

**What's my experience of the class?**
My experience in this class has been about what I expected it to be. I had heard a lot about the class from friends who had already taken it, and most of what they told me has held up. It definitely seems like a class that will benefit me a lot even though it also seems like it will take a lot of hard work. 

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
Don't try and upload a .xcf image to your GitHub page, it won't show up properly. I spent an embarrassingly long time trying to find the problem before I finally realized I just needed to switch the image format. I'm going to need a lot more practice making websites.

## Week of 22 Jan - 28 Jan:

**What did you do this past week?**
This past week I looked into ways to improve the performance of solving the Collatz problem. Downing provided us with a lot of good resources to accomplish this, as well as provided us with some ideas during class. I also read a lot about extreme programming, a management style that I had experienced somewhat during my internship but never really knew formally. I am also learning a lot about the importance of testing thoroughly and read a paper about how an entire rocket blew up because of a minor error in the code.

**What's in your way?**
Nothing except other work is currently in my way. I do need to get a better understanding of GitHub to be able to deal with all of the requirements for the project, but I am already fairly strong in python so the actual coding shouldn't take me very long. 

**What will you do next week?**
I still need to find a group to do the projects with. I also need to begin to learn JavaScript as it will be needed for one of the projects and I only have experience using it to write exploits. It would also be helpful for me to look into Travis CI more to get a better understanding of how that works as I know very little about the software.

**What's my experience of the class?**
I like the class so far. I'm definitely not a big fan of the quizzes every day, but it does do a good job of keeping me up with the reading, whether that is for better or worse any particular week. Downing is a very strong lecturer and it seems like his projects are going to be extremely helpful for strengthening my large-scale development and teamwork skills, even if they seem a bit silly for the small scale of the projects. 

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
If any of y'all are interested in machine vision, I would recommend checking out MatLab, it has a lot of great libraries for image processing and is extremely powerful. If Matlab is too expensive for you and you're not a student (students can get it free) then try Octave or Python's OpenCV, as they are also very strong.

## Week of 29 Jan - 4 Feb:

**What did you do this past week?**
This past week I finished the first project in this class as well as a project in cloud computing that automatically spins up an EC2 instance. This class's project didn't have a very difficult coding portion but learning to use all of the development tools he required ended up being a good amount of effort. In class, we went over a lot of information about what is going on behind the scenes in Python and Java, which feels a lot like 314 but does seem to be helping me get a better understanding of my code and allow for a lot more fluidity in my code.

**What's in your way?**
Nothing is currently in my way. Have a Machine Vision project due on Friday that could potentially take a long time so I am going to have to be very careful about managing my time next week.

**What will you do next week?**
I still need to find a group to work with for the upcoming project, so I will definitely get that done as I'm almost out of time. I fell pretty behind on my work finishing projects this week so hopefully, I will be able to catch back up on it next week, as I don't want to be too far behind when tests start to come up. 

**What's my experience of the class?**
The class is slowly introducing me to a whole new style of programming that is very strong in large groups or on long term projects. This will definitely make me a lot stronger asset during internships and maybe even on side projects if I ever begin to add others to them. I really like that the class is mainly in Python as I have been wanting to learn it formally for a while even though I've used it a lot in the past.

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
If you use your UT email to get AWS Educate you can get $100 of additional free credit to Amazon Web Services, so if any of y'all have code you need a lot of computing power to run that could be a great way to get through it without having to invest in better hardware. Its also a great resource to start getting use to as cloud computing continues to grow.

## Week of 5 Feb - 11 Feb:

**What did you do this past week?**
I finished working on my computer vision project this week. We got to create a program that could perform content-aware resizing using seam carving and use the program on a lot of images to test and create interesting results. For this class, my team and I finally found out an idea for the project and are starting to work our way through it. Personally I have set up the GitHub, briefly learned most of the development tools we are using to get a better idea of the project in general, and worked on getting the ever frustrating Instagram API to work.

**What's in your way?**
We are having some confusion on how to actually use Flask with Apache and AWS. I am starting to get a better understanding of what it's for and what its used for, but how to apply it to what we are doing still isn't clear. We are also having some difficulty with the Instagram API as it is way more confusing than the google one.

**What will you do next week?**
I plan to finish getting all of the data for the APIs to give to my team as well as figure out how to utilize flask and set it up with our project as my main priorities. I will also try and help with what is left over when I finish with those jobs. Hopefully, I will also get a chance to earn how everyone else did their parts as I would like to get an understanding of more than one part of the project.

**What's my experience of the class?**
The class has been good so far. I wish we would have been taught some of these development tools briefly in class so that we didn't have to go in blind, but it's not too big of an issue. The project is pretty challenging, especially since I have never worked on anything like this before, but I really like the challenge. 

**What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?**
If you have an image you want to resize that has a lot of fluff/unimportant content and you want to keep the main content the same size try looking into seam carving. It's a great way to do that by cutting out pixels you wouldn't really notice much anyway.
